https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Installation

Prerequisites:
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

After cloning the smartwallet-app repository to a directory on your computer, enter the directory and run the following command:

### Device Build

#### Android

Please set up an Android development environment. 

Then:

```bash
react-native run-android
yarn android
```
The first command will run and install a debug build on an attached Android device. A terminal window may pop up which starts a Metro Bundler, please stop this process.
The second command will start the Haul bundler and serve the build on your device if both are running on the same network. If remote debugging is enabled, the debugger-ui will also be available here.

#### iOS

Please set up the appropriate XCode development environment.

Then:

```bash
react-native run-ios --device
yarn ios
```

The first command will run and install a debug build on an attached iOS device. A terminal window may pop up which starts a Metro Bundler, please stop this process.
The second command will start the Haul bundler and serve the build on your device if both are running on the same network. If remote debugging is enabled, the debugger-ui will also be available here.
