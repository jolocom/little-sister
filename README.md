Jolocom SmartWallet - An application to manage your digital identity.

Setup for development
---------------------

Setup requires Node.JS to be installed on your computer. If you do not have it please see:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Installation

Prerequisites:
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

After cloning the smartwallet-app repository to a directory on your computer, enter the directory and run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Browser

#### With hot module reloading support

```bash
yarn start
```
This will make webpack-dev-server serve the application on https://localhost:8080 and will reload only the modules you've modified instead of rebuilding the entire bundle on every change. The changes will be applied live to your browser.

#### Without hot module reloading

```bash
yarn build:dev
```
Rebuilding will be much slower this way, because the entire bundle will be rebuilt on each change.

#### Using a local Gateway

```bash
GW=LOCAL yarn start
```
Sets local gateway as backend.

### Mobile (Cordova)

First make sure to build the Cordova distribution.

```bash
yarn build:cordova
```

#### iOS

```bash
yarn run ios
```

#### Android

```bash
yarn run android
```

### Notes

If you are getting the error `Module parse failed: main.jsx Line 1: Unexpected token`, switch to node version 4.x before running the gulp ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) might come in handy).

Setup for production
--------------------

## Installation
```bash
yarn install
```

### Browser

```bash
yarn build
```

### Mobile (Cordova)

#### iOS

A valid code sign identity & provisioning needs to be configured in `app/[ENTRY].json` before a release can be build.

```bash
gulp release:ios
```

#### Android

Building a valid release package requires a keystore to be configured in `app/[ENTRY].json`.

```bash
gulp release:android
```

Tests
-----

## Running tests locally

```bash
yarn test
```

## Writing tests

Frameworks used for testing: `Mocha`, `Chai`, `Sinon` and `Enzyme`.

1. Create a .test.js file either in the same directory as the file you're writing a test for, or in a /test subfolder.

2. Write your unit and component tests in this file.

3. Run `$ yarn test`

git-flow
--------

We are using git-flow to manage our branching strategy. More details can be found in [this article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Also, you should install a plugin for your git command line: [nvie/gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

Once you have installed the git flow plugin, you should initialize its branch mappings with this command:
```bash
git flow init -d
```
