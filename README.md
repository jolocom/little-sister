## Prerequisites

- Set-up requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed on your computer.
  - Starting with version `1.2.0` of the Jolocom SmartWallet, `Node.js v10+` is required to build the project. Versions prior to `1.2.0` require `Node.js v8`.
- We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as our package manager.

## Installation

1. Clone the smartwallet-app repository to your computer.
2. `cd` into the directory and run `yarn` or `yarn install` from your terminal to install the required packages.

### Running a debug version for development

#### Android

- Please set up an Android development environment and install the required SDKs.
  - The [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide for React Native may come in handy.
  - Look for the instructions under React Native CLI Quickstart.
- Connect an Android device and enable USB debugging **OR** start an Android AVD emulator
- Run `yarn run:android` to install the application and run it.
  - NOTE: this will start a metro bundler server automatically, with stdout/stderr discarded. You can close this and run `yarn start` to manually start the bundler and receive more detailed output.

### iOS

- Please set up an appropriate Xcode development environment.
  - The [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide for React Native may come in handy.
  - Look for the instructions under React Native CLI Quickstart.
- Run `yarn build:ios` to assemble the application bundle.
- Run `yarn run:ios` to install and run the application in an emulator.
  - This will default to an iPhone X emulator.
  - The device can be specified by adding `--simulator` and the device name.
    - e.g. `yarn run:ios --simulator "iPhone SE"`
  - NOTE: this will start a metro bundler server automatically, with stdout/stderr discarded. You can close this and run `yarn start` to manually start the bundler and receive more detailed output.

A debug build can also be built through Xcode.

Running a build on a physical device requires the appropriate code signing certificates.

## Testing and Formatting

Testing uses Jest. The following script enables watch and testing coverage display as well.

```bash
yarn test --watch --coverage
```

Use `yarn run` to display all scripts, e.g. for formatting.

- We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep a consistent style across the codebase.
  - There are plugins available for a range of IDEs and text editors; automatic formatting on save is also supported in some editors.
- `yarn format` will format files automatically as much as possible.
